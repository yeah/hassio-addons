# Homegear as a Hassio add-on

This is a add-on to install and use [homgear](https://homegear.eu/) on Hassio.


## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to Hass.io -> Add-On Store
2. Add the repository as [described here](https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons/)
3. Find and install "Homegear" add-on

Don't get nervous after you've hit **Install**. Depending on your hardware and network, it may take up to half an hour before Homegear is installed. Once it appears in the list of installed add-ons, you'll have to **open** and **start** it. I wan't to improve the installation speed soon.

## How it works

A folder named `homegear/` will be added to the `/config` directory of your Hassio installation. `/config` is where all your other Home Assistant config files live as well. You can [access it via Samba](https://home-assistant.io/addons/samba/) for example. `/config/homegear` corresponds to `/etc/homegear` in Homegear. You will need to add your configuration according to the [Homegear docs](https://doc.homegear.eu/homegear/configuration.html).

Homegear usually stores its database and other variable data in `/var/lib/homegear`. This directory will be mapped to `/share/homegear/lib` in Hassio. **It is advisable to perform backups of this folder!**

Homegear logs will be in `/share/homegear/log`.

More informations in the [Wiki](https://github.com/kreativmonkey/hassio-addons/wiki) (soon).

## Limitations

Works for meâ„¢, but your mileage may vary. I've tested Homematic/MAX! with an Raspberry Pi 3b+, Raspberry Pi 2b and the Hass.io container and an MAX! Cube with [CUL Firmware](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/converting-a-max-cube-to-cul-cun-to-use-with-home-assistant/74218).
